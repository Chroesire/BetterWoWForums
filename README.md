WoW Forums Userstyle

A userstyle that makes the official WoW forums use your system's font and optionally changes its background.

### Installation
You'll need a userstyle extension for your browser. My recommendations:
* Chrome: [Stylus for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en)
* Edge: [Stylus for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) (Edge can install Chrome extensions)
* Firefox: [Stylus for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
* Safari: [Cascadea](https://cascadea.app)

Once you have an extension, you should be able to install the userstyle by clicking below:
[Install User Style](https://github.com/Chroesire/BetterWoWForums/raw/main/BetterWoWForums.user.css)

At this point, navigate to the WoW forums or reload existing WoW forum tabs.

### Changing backgrounds
In your extension, edit the userstyle and copy the URL of the desired background into the `background-image` property.
